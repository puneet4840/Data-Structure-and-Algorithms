# ###  GRAPH
# Graph is a non-linear data structure.
# Graph is a collection of vertices and edges in which vertices are connected with each
#  through edges.


# # Examples:
# Set of cities connected by rail route.
# Facebook uses the graph data structure in which each person is a vertex and connection
#   between the people represented through edges.
# Google Maps uses the graph data structure to show the best possible route for you.
# Connectios among computer through router is in the form of graph data structure.


# # 4 - Types of Graph:
# 1: Undirected Graph.
# 2: Directed Graph.
# 3: Weighted Graph.
# 4: Unweighted Graph.



# # Representation of graph:
# Graph is represented in computer's memory in two ways.
# -> Adjacency Matrix.
# -> Adjacency List.
